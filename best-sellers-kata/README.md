Best Sellers Kata
=========

You do not need to write code for this kata (although writing short prototypes
might help you come to a conclusion).

Say you're writing code for a high-colume online site that sells
things(something like Amazon). Your site is wildly popular, and you sell
millions of items each day. 

The marketing department wants the home page to display a top-ten list of the
best selling items over the last 24 hours, with the list being updated each
hour.

How would you implement this?

Are there any changes you could ask for to make the implementation easier?

What would be the impact if they later came back and said:
- only update the list once per day; or
- we need the list updated in real time: each time the home page is displayed we
  need the list to reflect the 24 hours up until that point. 

This kata might be deeper than it first appears. You might want to consider
database vs. in-memory solutions, data structures that allow aging,
time-space tradeoffs, and the like.
